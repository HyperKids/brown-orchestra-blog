Sitting in silence while waiting for the click-clack of the soloist’s heels on the steps of Sayles Hall was one of the most thrilling moments of the opening concert of our March 2023 cycle. Sayles Hall was charged with excitement to celebrate our very own musicians as concerto competition winners, and Judy appeared in a stunning, floor-length crimson gown with matching flowers in her hair, slender flute in hand.


Judy Lee ‘26 is a first-year from Seoul, Korea studying Public Health and Music at Brown. Since her entrance to the music world 12 years ago, she has become an accomplished musician, versed in a multitude of instruments such as the piano, clarinet, violin, drums, and guitar. Her outstanding history includes events such as performing in other countries such as China, Hong Kong, and London, winning a nationwide concerto competition, and performing a concerto with one of Korea’s most prestigious orchestras, City Philharmonic in Korea.


Her previous knowledge of the piece inspired her to revisit her concerto, Fantaisie Brillante on Themes from Bizet's Carmen by François Borne, with the BUO. She expressed how it was “an honor to perform as a soloist” and enjoyed rehearsing with Conductor Mark Seto and the orchestra, especially appreciating his attention to detail and constant communication.


It was truly the orchestra’s joy to be able to accompany Judy Lee this past March cycle, and while she is not sure of any concerto performances in the near future, she hopes to continue as a flutist for the orchestra while navigating her upcoming upperclassman years.
