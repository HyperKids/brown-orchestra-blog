In order to comply with Brown’s guidelines on in-person gatherings, this semester the Brown University Orchestra will explore chamber orchestra repertoire (19 students maximum at a time, strings and percussion only). If there is sufficient interest, there will be two cohorts with separate repertoire and rehearsal times. One group will have in-person rehearsals on Thursdays from 5-6:20pm, and the other group will meet on Thursdays from 7:20-8:40pm. Additional activities such as repertoire study will take place online. Repertoire may include: Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Serenade for Strings; Jessie Montgomery, Strum; George Walker, Lyric for Strings; Caroline Shaw, Entr’acte; Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Novelletten for Strings ; and Dmitri Shostakovich, Chamber Symphony, Op. 110a. Programming will be finalized after auditions have concluded.
