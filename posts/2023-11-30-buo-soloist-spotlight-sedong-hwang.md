Originally from Irvine, California, Sedong Hwang’s introduction to the world of music began at the age of five. At first picking up the violin, a redirection by his mother towards the cello became a defining choice, one that he looks back on today with deep gratitude. This pivotal decision has not only shaped his musical identity but has also fostered a connection to the cello that surpasses any other instrument, providing him with a comfortable and intimate medium for artistic expression.

Private lessons during his formative years played a pivotal role in shaping Sedong's musical trajectory. In seventh grade, an encounter with Robert deMaine, the principal cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, marked the beginning of his lasting relationship with the cello. Sedong’s weekly lessons with DeMaine not only expanded his musical horizons but also introduced him to the art of storytelling through music. Sedong fondly reminisces about those early lessons where deMaine encouraged him to strive for more than just technical proficiency. "Every lesson stretched my brain," he reflects, revealing the transformative power of storytelling through music. Vivid imagery, such as a hat flying off a man during a fast-paced passage, became a wellspring of artistic inspiration, breathing life into the notes and opening up new dimensions of musical expression.

High school witnessed Sedong's unwavering commitment to music, evident through his membership in esteemed ensembles such as the Pacific Symphony Youth Orchestra. Additionally, he completed three years at the Montecito International Music Festival and spent six years with Junior Chamber Music. During his time with Junior Chamber Music, he toured and performed in cities including Boston, New York, Vienna, Prague, and Budapest. His group was also recognized as the leading chamber group for three consecutive seasons. The prospect of pursuing a career as a performer seemed likely. However, in the spirit of personal growth and intellectual adventure, Sedong chose a different path forward.

Joining the Brown University Orchestra in his freshman year, Sedong maintained an active role in Brown’s music community throughout his four years. At first he intended to study music and philosophy, but his love for programming led him to pursue a degree in computer science. Asked about this decision, Sedong, now a senior, reflects, "I didn't need a degree to tell me that I'm a musician." Drawing parallels between programming and music, he recognizes the common principles of learning established rules and the importance of repetition in practice. However, Sedong also notes the value of bending the rules in both disciplines. In music, he points to the ability of a soloist to take extra time to create a special effect beyond what is strictly marked in the score.

As Sedong prepares for his December 9th performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto, he describes the piece as "very grieving" with a "subtle, muted sadness." For him, the concerto is a vehicle for conveying nuanced emotions, a sentiment which resonated with Sedong during a difficult period in the 11th grade, allowing him to express emotions through music when words proved inadequate. Recognizing the relationship between Elgar's search for meaning and the introspective nature of the concerto, Sedong's evolving perspective brings a unique depth to his performance.

While the beauty of the concerto’s third movement makes it Sedong’s favorite between the four, the most powerful moment in the piece, he shares, lies near the very end. The converging themes bring back memories from earlier in the piece, and the suppressed despair approaches uninhibited wailing– a feeling that washes over Sedong in the intensity of performance. Acknowledging the complexity of Elgar's final work, Sedong notes the seemingly unorganized structure of the concerto, suggesting that perhaps the composer was “pouring his heart into something that doesn’t exist.”

This concert marks Sedong’s first performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto with an orchestral accompaniment, an experience he describes as "just fun." His familiarity with the piece and the orchestra's collaborative support create a special synergy, making the performance a delightful culmination of individual practice and a broader musical purpose.

For the audience attending the December 9th performance, Sedong's advice is simple: "Sit back, relax, and have fun!" He invites them to immerse themselves in the poignant beauty of Elgar's composition, hoping that the music resonates with each listener in a unique and meaningful way. 

In tracing Sedong's musical path from Irvine to Brown, the Elgar Cello Concerto emerges as a central artistic focus—a testament to his growth as a performer and a reflection of the profound impact music has on his journey through life.
