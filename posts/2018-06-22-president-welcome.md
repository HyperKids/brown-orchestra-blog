Hello all! My name is Rainbow Chen and I am the President of the Brown University Orchestra for the 2019-2020 school year! I am a double bassist concentrating in Education Policy and History and I am extremely honored and delighted to lead the orchestra board and represent the orchestra this year. I hope that myself and my Vice President Michael Tu ‘22 can continue the wonderful work that our former President and Vice President Lucy Duda ‘20 and Max Naftol ‘19 have done to help give our orchestra members an unforgettable orchestral experience.

The past few years have been a time of exciting change for the Brown University Orchestra and this year is no different! The 2018-2019 school year “mark”ed the end of our first year with Mark Seto, our new director of the orchestra, and we’re pleased to say that it’s been a wonderful first year!

At around 90 members (with about a record 40 first-years!), the Brown University Orchestra performed a variety of pieces ranging from classics like Mahler Symphony no. 1 and Saint-Saens Symphony no. 3 “Organ” featuring Brown University Organist Mark Steinbach, a memorial event for tubist Anthony Brattoli featuring former conductor Paul Phillips, to solo work with artist-in-residence Kinan Azmeh’s Clarinet Concerto (which was just premiered with the Seattle Symphony right before own performance) and Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto featuring Concerto Competition Winner Typher Yom ‘19.

Aside from performing incredible pieces in our favorite Sayles Hall, we’ve had many opportunities during rehearsal to bond and get to know each other. We’ve had multiple pizza socials, board game nights, movie nights, Valentine’s Day Speed-”Friending”, and hanging out outside of rehearsal!

We’ve had so much fun over the past year, but as we neared the end of our season, we had to say farewell to our graduating senior class. This year, we said goodbye to 5 violinists, 3 violists, 3 cellists, 2 bassists, an oboist, a bassoonist, a trumpet player, a horn player, and a percussionist (a whopping 18 seniors!!), many of which have stayed in the orchestra for all 4 years of their time at Brown! BUT! When one door closes, another door opens and we’re extremely excited for what’s in store for the upcoming year.

With the continuing construction of Brown’s first official Performing Arts Center, over 50 incoming first-years signing up to potentially join the orchestra, and an incredible orchestra program in the 2019-2020 school year, this upcoming year will be a BLAST! To stay connected and updated on what we’re up to, please follow us on social media and look out for an upcoming Brown Orchestra newsletter! We can’t wait to show what we’re doing this year!

Yours truly,
Rainbow Chen ‘21
President of the Brown University Orchestra
