Though our spring semester was regretfully cut short, the Music Department had the chance to create a video featuring three members of the recent senior class: Neil Goh and Derek Xu, recent winners of the Concerto Competition, and Max Friedman, a student composer whose work the Orchestra was planning on performing this past spring. We would like to thank the co-producers and directors Zoe Boggs '22 and Pinya Pipatjarasgit '22 for the beautiful video souvenir of this past year and the dedication and talent of this group of seniors. Enjoy!
