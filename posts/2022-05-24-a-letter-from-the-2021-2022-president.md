Dear friends of the BUO,

Hello! I am Haley Seo, and I’ve had the pleasure of serving as the Brown University Orchestra’s president for the 2021-2022 season. It’s been my honor and delight to be able to continue the amazing work done by my predecessors in fostering the BUO community.

It’s been an eventful year from the beginning, as we navigated how to perform and create music together all while safely transitioning into a more in-person experience. From outdoor rehearsals on Ruth Simmons quadrangle to strange mask contraptions for woodwind and brass musicians, we were all itching to perform together for more than a year. We are so very fortunate to announce four successful seasons this year, with more than one hundred members of this orchestra from all class years, every one of whom dedicated countless hours to rehearsing and performing.

The programs of this past year explore diversity, the cycle of life, and themes of hope and rebirth. We performed numerous pieces over a wide range of styles and eras, from Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird,” and Florence Price’s Symphony No. 3, to Leonard Bernstein’s “Symphonic Dances from West Side Story” and the world premiere of Exospheres, composed by Max Friedman ‘20. We have also had wonderful opportunities to speak with composers as well as perform their works: activist and composer Gabriela Lena Frank and her “Latin American Dances”, and violist and composer Kenji Bunch and his “Verso”. 

Beyond performances, we were also fortunate to hold numerous events for orchestra bonding, from instrument sections dressing up on Halloween, screening West Side Story together, and hosting our second Winter Ball with live music by our musicians. Our orchestra family has grown and thrived this past year!

As we end our season and welcome the summer heat, we say farewell to our seventeen graduates of the class of 2022, and send them off with hope as we thank them for their love for BUO. We have been so grateful for an amazing ‘21-’22 season, and are even more excited for the upcoming year! 

From the completion of the long-awaited Performing Arts Center, to welcoming the next cohort of first-year musicians to this community, we can’t wait to continue making music and building this community together. Stay connected with us on social media, and we hope to bring you more music!

Musically yours,  
Haley Seo ‘23  
BUO President ‘21-’22
