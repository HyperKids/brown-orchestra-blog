To our BUO Community,

My name is Thomas Gotsch, and I’ve had the joy of serving as the Brown University Orchestra president for the past year. It’s been a very full season for us, and a great honor for me to carry on the responsibilities of board leadership as we continue to fulfill our mission of quality music performance alongside the stewardship of our wonderful community.

It is with gratitude and appreciation that we welcomed Associate Professor of Music Eric Nathan as interim director of BUO in the fall. Under his baton, the orchestra performed a wide-ranging repertoire from Giovanni Gabrieli to Brown graduate student Inga Chinilina, and we also welcomed cellist virtuoso Zlatomir Fung in a stunning performance of Anna Clyne’s DANCE. With Mark’s return in the spring, we hit the ground running with Gustav Mahler’s monumental Symphony No. 6, and concluded our season with an exciting program featuring piano soloists [James Carl Osorio](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Music/sites/orchestra/news/2025-04-03/buo-soloist-spotlight-james-carl-osorio) and [Robert Shlyakhtenko](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Music/sites/orchestra/news/2025-04-03/buo-soloist-spotlight-robert-shlyakhtenko) (interviews on our website), as well as works by Márquez and Bonds.

With more than one hundred members who dedicated countless hours to the orchestra, we have had the great pleasure to perform four fantastic concerts, hold several orchestra bonding events, and share many special moments together! One such moment occurred when students in Mark’s conducting class took to the podium and led the BUO. Another time, members of WNYC's Radiolab for Kids recorded the orchestra performing flatulent sound effects for their [podcast episode](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab-kids/articles/the-windbreaker-why-farts-make-the-world-go-round) “The Windbreaker: Why Farts Make the World Go Round” (the bassoon and trombone players weren’t the only ones who had fun!). And as a cherry on top, BUO musicians were able to play in Copland’s Appalachian Spring and Max Richter’s Four Seasons Recomposed in live performances during Brown’s Spring Festival of Dance, produced by Patricia Seto-Weiss and featuring both student dancers and the visiting Martha Graham Dance Company.

Outside of these performances, we welcomed nearly 150 guests at our annual Orchestra Ball, and featured 11 musical groups (including the BUO cello and clarinet sections), totaling more than 75 individual performers from all different musical traditions. We also enjoyed a Ratatouille watch party, several potlucks, and many concert setups—though perhaps sadly to some of our nostalgic readers, with flatbread instead of bagels. With the opening of the Lindemann Performing Arts Center and our increased engagement with programs like Providence’s Community Music Works, we are excited to write a new page in BUO’s history. Like bagels to flatbread, we are sad to see some traditions go (alas! No more moves to Sayles…), but look forward to the future ahead, with parts both new and familiar.

It goes without saying that many of our graduates likely feel a similar way about their own futures, and we would like to take this moment to feature them. To our class of ‘25—Lizzy, Stella, Elvin, Tiger, Chloe, Brian, Charlie, Eric, Torben, Anna, Kyoko, Faith, William, Michael, Seehanah, Emily, Sam, Sean, Tats: Thank you for four years of music, community, and connection. We appreciate your leadership and the way you welcomed younger students into the orchestra, and we’re grateful for all the moments we shared together. Wishing you the best on your next adventures, and don’t be a stranger!

Thank you also to our board members—Eliana, Henry, Ian, Hannah, Ryan, Anne, Zoë, Michelle, Torben, Yujin, Emma, Neil, Chloe, Nathan, Daniel, Kajsa, Meg, and Audrey—for all of your hard work over this past year. Your ideas and dedication gave us a wonderful orchestra ball, smoothly run concerts, and many other fun memories.

To our readers, we look forward to welcoming many of you at our 2025-2026 season concerts, which will include exciting performances of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloe Suite No. 2, the world premiere of a BUO musician’s original composition, and several concertos featuring both student and professional soloists. Beyond programming, we hope to continue to share exciting projects that BUO undertakes over the coming months. Stay tuned!

With well wishes to all,

Thomas Gotsch ‘26

BUO Board President ‘24-’25
