Due to the spread of the Coronavirus and world-wide lockdowns, the Brown University Orchestra has unfortunately cancelled the rest of the 2019-2020 season. Hopefully, we will be back in the fall and then you will be able to find our 2020-2021 season schedule as soon as it is finalized. In the meantime, the Orchestra is also working on some virtual music projects which you won't want to miss! Follow our social media (linked to the left) or check back at this page for updates!

Below you'll see a photo from our last concert of the season in March - we were proud to accompany Violinist Jennifer Koh (depicted in the center of the photo) in the Barber Violin Concerto and Vijay Iyer's Trouble. You can see our "Previous Seasons" page for more info on 2019-2020 season.
