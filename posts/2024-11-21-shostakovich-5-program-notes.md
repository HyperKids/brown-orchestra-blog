Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) grew up during massive political change in Russia. In
1917, the czar of Russia was overthrown. By 1920, the Bolsheviks, a Marxist revolutionary
party, had executed the former czar and secured control over Russia and many of its former
imperial territories, founding the Soviet Union, with their Communist Party in charge.
It was in this revolutionary Soviet context where Shostakovich began work as a
composer. The 1920s Soviet Music scene was a pluralistic environment where many styles of
classical music, from experimental avant-garde music to more traditional compositions jostled
for a place as music fitting of the revolutionary era. Shostakovich’s atonal and dissonant
compositions of the 1920s also pushed the boundaries of traditional classical music.
However, beginning in the late 1920s under the Bolsheviks’ new dictator, Joseph Stalin,
the atonal style of the early-to-mid 1920s was discouraged. Instead, optimistic and nationalist
“Socialist Realism” music that would lead the country into the socialist utopia was in favor.
Shostakovich himself came under crossfire after, in 1936, Stalin himself attended a performance
of Shostakovich’s acclaimed (but provocative and dissonant) opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.
The dictator did not enjoy the opera, and the next day, the state-run newspaper Pravda published
a scathing review of Shostakovich’s music. Overnight, Shostakovich went from a celebrated
composer to anathema. He began to sleep on the stairwell of his apartment, to spare his family
from violence in case he was arrested in the middle of the night.


At the same time, beginning in 1936 and 1937, Stalin began mass purges of the Soviet
elite in what would be known as the Terror. Anyone, from loyal Communist Party officials to
ordinary citizens, could be arrested and disappear: executed or sent to labor camps. Mikhail
Tukhachevsky, a Communist Party official and artistic patron of Shostakovich, was arrested and
shot. In this context of suspicion and fear, Shostakovich premiered his 5th Symphony.
Most historians interpret Shostakovich’s 5th Symphony as an effort to compose an
optimistic piece that matched the party line. The 5th Symphony begins with a bold and
recognizable sonata in the 1st movement, mixed with slower, somber moments. The 2nd
movement is an energetic, lively scherzo. This is followed by the dramatic, percussive, and
somber 3rd movement. The symphony ends with an overtly joyful, triumphant 4th movement.
Shostakovich publicly stated that his 5th Symphony was inspired by human optimism, and it was
indeed a critical (and political) success, rehabilitating him in the Party’s eyes.
Some historians, conductors, and musicologists theorize that Shostakovich purposefully
hid an element of subversion within the 5th Symphony’s notes. They might understand the
somber tone in the 1st and 3rd movements as a cry for help or expression of fear. Others interpret
the triumphal 4th movement’s final march, with its almost agonizingly repeated chords, as a
statement of angst, rather than a triumphant finale. Yet others question the idea that Shostakovich
would have taken the risk of including hidden notes of subversion within the very symphony
intended to rehabilitate his image.


The 5th Symphony is a complicated piece, and it is impossible for us to know with
certainty what Shostakovich felt and thought of the music. For each of you audience members,
the Symphony will likely conjure up unique emotions and thoughts as well. There is no
objectively correct take on the 5th Symphony, no correct way to “feel” or interpret it. However, it
is our hope as the Brown University Orchestra that through this piece, Shostakovich says
something to you tonight. We hope you enjoy our performance!
