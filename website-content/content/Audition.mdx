# Fall 2023 Ensemble and Audition Information

The Brown University Orchestra will hold Fall 2023 auditions from Tuesday, September 6 to Sunday, September 11. Links to sign up for an audition time will be added to this page by mid-August. Based on Brown’s current safety protocols, we anticipate that auditions will be fully in person, but this document will be updated with new information if necessary.
