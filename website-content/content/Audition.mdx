# Fall 2021 Audition Information
We are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for running a full orchestra with winds and brass, and are planning to hold auditions accordingly at the beginning of the semester. Please view the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRQrElM2V6kHiqBJn-aHA-dI6w89Qy8m2af2YJIglCM/edit?usp=sharing">Fall 2021 Audition Document</a> for up-to-date audition information.

This year's excerpts are linked in the document above.

# About Auditions
Participation in the Brown University Orchestra is open to all members of the Brown community: undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff. Members of the RISD community are also eligible to participate. Musicians from the local community are welcome to audition and may be invited to join if openings exist.

Each fall, all musicians interested in joining the orchestra are required to audition, including returning members. Individuals who are abroad or away during the fall should audition at the start of the spring semester.

The audition will take approximately 10 minutes and consist of the following parts (no sight reading or scales will be required):

- A two-minute excerpt of a work of your choice. This piece should display your best playing, and demonstrate your technical and expressive capabilities. You may bring a second contrasting selection, but it is not required and might not be requested because of time constraints.

- Orchestral excerpts drawn from the upcoming season’s repertoire (one or two excerpts, depending on the instrument). This year’s excerpts are available below.

Anyone who plays a secondary instrument, like piccolo, English horn, bass clarinet, etc., is encouraged to bring it to the audition and prepare the associated excerpt, if possible. If you plan to audition on more than one instrument and think you will need more than 10 minutes, sign up for two audition times (preferably back-to-back).

Rosters and seating assignments will be announced once all auditions have been completed. Rotating seating is used in the string sections, with new assignments for each concert. Principal string players are selected from the pool of principals determined by the auditions. Seating in the rest of the orchestra rotates to varying degrees according to each section. No distinction is made between music and non-music concentrators when determining seating; our philosophy is to judge chair placement based on the fall audition and subsequent performance in rehearsals and concerts.

## For Prospective Members
Incoming students are encouraged to visit the Orchestra Open House (Thursday, September 9, 2021 at 7pm in Alumnae Hall), where they can meet conductor Mark Seto as well as returning students in the orchestra. Please audition! We accept large numbers of new members every year, and chair placement is not determined by class year. First-year students have the same shot as everyone else who auditions. Although orchestra is a time commitment, students taking the most difficult course loads at Brown still find the time to perform.

Access to large instruments such as percussion, harp, and tuba can be arranged by emailing the conductor, Mark Seto. If you have any questions or concerns about auditions, don’t hesitate to contact him.
