# Fall 2022 Ensemble and Audition Information

The Brown University Orchestra will hold auditions for the 2022-2023 season from Tuesday, September 6 to Sunday, September 11. Links to sign up for an audition time will be added to this page by mid-August. Based on Brown’s current safety protocols, we anticipate that auditions will be fully in person, but this document will be updated with new information if necessary.

## C﻿oncerto Competition

The Brown University Orchestra sponsors its annual concerto competition each fall semester to give its most highly talents members the opportunity to perform as soloists with the orchestra. This privilege is also extended to musicians at Brown whose specialties do not generally allow membership in an orchestra: pianists, vocalists, and players of guitar, saxophone, and other non-orchestra instruments. [Guidelines for the 2022 competition are available here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQkyB1RXFMh-HZ6iqk6lTHWa7Kt2G1MsVp_1oOVQS_8/edit?usp=sharing)
