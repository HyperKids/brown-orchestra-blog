# Fall 2022 Ensemble and Audition Information

The Brown University Orchestra will hold auditions for the 2022-2023 season from Tuesday, September 6 to Sunday, September 11. Links to sign up for an audition time will be added to this page by mid-August. Based on Brownâ€™s current safety protocols, we anticipate that auditions will be fully in person, but this document will be updated with new information if necessary.
