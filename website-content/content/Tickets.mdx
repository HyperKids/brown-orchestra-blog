*"\[In the fall of 2023], the Brown community celebrates yet another remarkable milestone for the arts: the opening of The Lindemann Performing Arts Center. The Lindemann offers new horizons for artistic exploration for Brown students and faculty, local community members and distinguished artists from around the world. More than an arts venue, The Lindemann is a state-of-the-art research laboratory that will qualitatively transform the Brown Arts ecosystem, stimulating new modes of art making, encouraging innovative collaborations across knowledge domains and activating the creative imaginations of artistic communities at Brown and beyond.*

*With a radical, one-of-a-kind approach to spatial, acoustic and technical flexibility, Brown University’s 101,000-square-foot Lindemann Performing Arts Center, designed by Joshua Ramus/REX, will inspire dynamic art-making, enable new forms of artistic collaboration and serve as a hub for performance at Brown. The opening of The Lindemann heralds a new era in Brown Arts history and arrives in concert with the extensive creative offerings of campus and Providence-based artists and arts organizations, as well as the renewed commitment to the arts by Providence city government. Through transformative architectural forms and an infusion of soul-sustaining light, The Lindemann Performing Arts Center, newly located at the heart of Brown University’s campus, inspires an equally nimble boundary-pushing programmatic approach."*
