## Music at Brown
The Department of Music at Brown offers a huge array of performing opportunities, all offered for academic credit. Students may choose to join one of the department's many performing groups, including: orchestra, chorus, chamber choir, wind symphony, jazz band, marching band, chamber music ensemble, Ghanaian drumming ensemble, Old-Time string band, Sacred Harp Shape-Note Singing, Electro-Acoustic Improv Ensemble, and Javanese Gamelan. Or, for an additional fee, they may elect to take private lessons through our Applied Music Program. Approximately thirty professional musicians from the greater Boston-Providence area provide weekly instruction in voice, keyboard, and all the wind, string, brass and percussion instruments. Master classes, student recitals, new music concerts, and an annual concerto competition round out a regular roster of concerts. All Brown students are eligible to participate, regardless of their concentration.

## The BUO
Performing with the Brown University Orchestra is unlike performing with any other music ensemble on the planet. The majority of the student performers are not studying for a music degree, but still perform at the caliber of a conservatory orchestra. The conductor is a former pupil of Leonard Bernstein, world renowned conductor and composer, but still treats each member with great respect as a mentor and a life-long friend. Above all, the camraderie and support that the orchestra gives truly makes it a giant family. Many undergraduates meet some of their best friends through the orchestra, and continue to perform with the BUO all four years. The orchestra also allows undergraduates the chance to interact with the graduate students and members from the community who are in the BUO. There is no reason to give up music in college because of the difficulty of a Brown course load - many members are studying time intensive subjects or pursuing multiple concentrations. Performing with the BUO is one of the most thrilling things you can do at Brown - between traveling across the globe for tours, getting to meet famous musicians and composers, and honing your chops in rehearsal, you will find yourself looking forward to each new adventure planned on the orchestra schedule.
