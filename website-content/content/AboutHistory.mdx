# A Brief History
## 1775 - 1886
Not much is known about the status of a student orchestra during this period. Brown's first music group, The Harmonic Society (a singing club), was formed in 1775 - only 11 years after the University was established. The first reference to a student orchestra appeared in a poster for a concert at Seekonk Town Hall on April 19th, 1858 (see photo below). From 1858 to 1886, brief mentions of the occasional class orchestra appeared in various newspapers, including the Brown Daily Herald.
## 1886 - 1919
In 1886, a new group called the "Symphonic Society" began performing winter concerts annually. This group of musicians (all men), consisted of no more than about 20 players and would perform "out of doors" evening concerts for the students. The Society attracted the attention of Dr. Walter Damrosch, leader of the New York Orchestra, who came to give lecture on December 11th, 1891 and conducted the orchestra in a concert that evening. In 1895, the Brown Music Department was established, allowing for a more professional atmosphere and coaching of the music on campus. As the popularity for orchestral music on the Brown campus grew, the Society began performing more an more shows - culminating in concerts every Tuesday evening during the Fall semester of 1901. From 1901 onward, the society began to disband, performing scattered concerts with no consistent rehearsal schedule. Another group of students attempted to create an orchetra in 1912, but never had enough members to sustain competition against the symphonic society.
## 1919 - 1940
Finally in the winter 1919, the precursor group that would come to be The Brown University Orchestra was born. This group of undergraduates, known as ahe College Orchestra, would have a clearly defined leadership structure as well as a rehearsal plan (rehearsals were publicly announced in the Brown Daily Herald for the few years of their existence). In the early 1920's the orchestra performed around 20 concerts a year to enthusiastic audiences. The orchestra was student conducted under the coaching of Leonard Smith. As the popularity of radio grew, the number of orchestra concerts reduced to a low of 8 concerts for the 1924-1925 academic year. The first major performance of this orchestra outside of the Brown Campus was on April 26th, 1926 at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. As the prevalence of jazz orchestras grew on campus, not enough members or interest was available to sustain an orchestra. The orchestra disbanded for the 1928-1929 academic year.
## 1940 - 1953
Leading up to 1940, the popularity of the College Orchestra began to grow again, attracting the attention of the Brown Daily Herald, which began to give concert reviews for the orchestra. Starting in 1940, the College Orchestra was renamed to the Brown-Pembroke orchestra and became a combined effort of men from Brown College, and women from Pembroke College, just up the hill. The orchestra integrated men and women performers over 30 years before Brown and Pembroke college became fully integrated in to Brown University. The new combined orchestra would be the first orchestra to perform at the New York World's Fair on May 12, 1940.
## 1953 - 1989
In 1953, the Brown-Pembroke Orchestra officially changed its name to the familiar title of the "Brown University Orchestra", signifying both the acceptance of graduate performers into the orchestra, as well as a step towards full Brown-Pembroke integration into a larger university (18 years before the full merge in 1971). The popularity of student jazz orchestras outside of the Brown University continued into 1958, when a group known as the Brunotes spent a grand total of 50 days in Europe playing a series of concerts in night-clubs in Europe, and a performance at the World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium. In 1987, the Brown University Orchestra made a premiere on the Carnegie Hall stage in New York City, performing Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony and Symphony of Psalms by Stravinsky with the Brown University Chorus, raising money for the department. By that point orchestra had grown to a size of 120 (roughly the size it is today).
## 1989 - 2017
Distinguished conductor and former pupil of Leonard Bernstein, Paul Phillips became musical director and conductor of the Brown University Orchestra in the Fall of 1989. He has rehearsed the orchestra to perfection, helping to put its name on the musical map on a global scale. In December 2006, the Brown Orchestra became one of the first US collegiate orchestras to tour China, performing a two-week New Year’s concert tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Suzhou, Changzhou and Ningbo produced by the Dalian Yilong Performance Company. Most recently, the Brown orchestra completed a 10 day tour of Ireland. The tour included performances with ethe Limerick Choral Union and a performance in the famous Wexford Opera Hall. A documentary about this trip can be found in the media section of this website, located here.

Itzhak Perlman, Navah Perlman ’92, Pinchas Zukerman, Eugenia Zukerman, Isaac Stern, Sergiu Luca, Mstislav Rostropovich, Laurence Lesser, Masuko Ushioda and Joseph Kalichstein are among the many renowned musicians who have appeared as soloists with the Brown University Orchestra in past seasons. Actors Barry Bostwick and Brown alumna Kate Burton ’79 performed Peter Boyer's multimedia composition Ellis Island: The Dream of America with the orchestra in 2004 at Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence. Composers-in-residence hosted by the Brown Orchestra include Steve Reich, Steven Stucky, Michael Torke, Lukas Foss and Samuel Adler. Notable events in the orchestra’s history include trips to New York for concerts in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall and to Montreal for a concert and recording sessions with choruses from McGill University; a 2006 concert in Boston’s Faneuil Hall; and concert exchanges and collaborations with orchestras and choruses from MIT, Tufts and Wellesley.

The Brown University Orchestra, a member of the American Symphony Orchestra League, has won the prestigious ASCAP Award for "Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music" seven times since 1994, including 1st Prize in 2005 in the Collegiate Orchestra Division. Each fall the BUO sponsors an orchestra retreat (usually held at Brown’s Haffenreffer Grant in Bristol, RI, or at Camp Canonicus in Exeter, RI) and its annual Concerto Competition, whose winners (usually 2-3 per year) perform full concertos with the orchestra. In addition to student soloists, numerous student conductors and composers have performed with (or had their works performed by) the Brown Orchestra. The orchestra’s alumni include current and former members of the Chicago Symphony, New York Philharmonic, New World Symphony and other outstanding orchestras.
