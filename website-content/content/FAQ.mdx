###### The Brown University Orchestra performes in Sayles Hall.

## How many musicians are in the Brown University Orchestra?

The current membership of the Brown University Orchestra comprises of approximately 29 violins, 11 violas, 9 cellos, 7 double basses, 5 flutes, 5 oboes, 5 clarinets, 5 bassoons, 7 horns, 6 trumpets, 6 trombones, 1 tuba, 3 harps, 1 keyboard, and 7 timpani/percussion, for a total of around 107 enrolled members this academic year.

## Who are the members of the orchestra?

This year's orchestra is made up of Brown undergraduates, Brown graduate students, RISD undergraduates, musicians from other colleges, and musicians from the greater community. Occasionally, Brown and RISD faculty and staff, and community members, are accepted into the orchestra, but this occurs relatively rarely. Generally about 70% of the Brown students in the orchestra pursue concentrations in the physical sciences, computer science, mathematics, or engineering, with the other 30% concentrating in the humanities. This year there are 12 music concentrators in the orchestra. No distinction is made between music and non-music concentrators in the orchestra - our philosophy is to judge chair placement based on audition and performance in rehearsal/concerts.

## I'm not a Brown student. Can I join the orchestra?

There is always a possibility. Students from other colleges and universities, faculty and staff, and community members, including talented high school students, may audition for the Brown Orchestra with the understanding that priority for membership will be given to students from Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design.

## What is the audition process?

Orchestra auditions are held each September during the first week of classes of the fall semester. The audition lasts approximately 10 minutes and begins with a two-minute excerpt of a work of your choice - a piece that displays your best playing (usually an etude or movement of a suite, partita, sonata, or concerto). You may bring a second contrasting piece, but it is not required. In addition, you will be asked to sightread and play scales. Any student who plays a secondary instrument, like piccolo, English horn, E flat clarinet, bass clarinet, etc., is encouraged to bring it to the audition, if possible.

## Is it feasible to join the Orchestra my first semester on campus?

Absolutely. Freshman are encouraged to join and visit the Orchestra Open House, where they can meet conductor Mark Seto as well as upperclassmen in the orchestra. Chair placement is not determined by class year - freshman have the same shot as everyone else who auditions. Although orchestra is a time commitment, students taking the most difficult course loads at Brown still find the time to perform.

## Are returning members required to reaudition?

Yes. Each fall, all students interested in joining the orchestra are required to audition, including returning members. Only students who were abroad or away during the fall are required to audition at the start of the spring semester.

## Does the orchestra provide instruments?

Yes. The Brown University Orchestra possesses an inventory of high-quality instruments available for use by orchestra members. These include 2 clarinets in A, clarinet in E flat, bass clarinet in B flat (all Buffet instruments), an English horn (Lor√©e), two bassoons (Fox, Polisi), a contrabassoon (Polisi), 2 trumpets in C (Yamaha), a bass trombone (Bach), a bass tuba (Miraphone), a harp (Lyon & Healy), and multiple double basses. The orchestra also possesses timpani and a large battery of percussion instruments, including marimba and vibraphone.

## Is it possible to join the orchestra mid-year?

Yes, if openings exist. If a student who has been studying abroad during the fall semester would like to join, accomodations for a spring audition can be arranged. Contact Mark Seto for more information at orchestra@brown.edu.

## When do rehearsals take place?

Rehearsals are held in Alumnae Hall (Pembroke Campus across from Andrews Dining Hall) on Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7:15-9:45 PM.

## How many concerts does the orchestra perform each year?

It varies. Generally the orchestra plays 8-10 concerts per year (4-5 programs, each performed twice). During years that include special events such as tours, recordings, children's concerts, musicals, dance performances, or opera, the number of concerts can increase to as many as 18 or more. Each program is usually around 2 hours in length, with an intermission in the middle. A typical concert may include 1-2 shorter pieces (less than 30 minutes) and a full symphony.

## Can I be a member of the orchestra without registering for the course (MUSC 0610-0611)?

Students are encouraged to register for the course to obtain Brown credit for their time spent with the orchestra. All ensembles taken at Brown are worth 0.5 credits, to allow students to enroll in multiple ensembles while remaining within the 5 credit limit for full-time students. In the unique case that a student has already filled out a full course load (5 full credits), a student can still join the orchestra, although their intentions should be made known to conductor Mark Seto at the beginning of the semester. The requirements for orchestra membership are the same whether you take it for credit or not.

## Are there opportunities to play concertos with the orchestra?

Yes. The orchestra holds an annual Concerto Competition each fall, with a panel of professional musicians serving as judges. The competition is open to all members of the Brown University Orchestra as well as other Brown University undergraduate pianists, vocalists, and players of mainly non-orchestral instruments such as saxophone, guitar, or organ. Usually 2-3 winners are chosen each year, each of whom performs a complete concerto or solo work in two performances. There is no limit to the number of times that students may enter and win the competition. This means that any undergraduate from their freshman year onward is eligible. Students who typically win have been studying a concerto in conjunction with their teacher from the Applied Music Program (AMP).

## What opportunities are there for student conductors and composers?

Qualified undergraduate students may serve as Assistant Conductor of the Brown University Orchestra. There are also extensive opportunities for students to conduct the Brown Spring Opera, Fall Operetta/Scenes Concert, or Children's Opera with Brown Opera Productions (BOP), operetta with Brown University Gilbert & Sullivan, musicals at Production Workshop (PW), contemporary works with several new music ensembles, music for winds with Brown Wind Symphony, and choral music with Brown University Chorus. Past Assistant Conductors of the BUO have pursued graduate study at Juilliard, Curtis, and other leading conservatories, and currently hold positions with collegiate and professional orchestras, including the Nashville Symphony. The Brown University Orchestra has performed numerous works by undergraduate composers, who may submit works for performance consideration at any time. Readings of compositions and orchestral arrangements by undergraduate student composers take place annually.
