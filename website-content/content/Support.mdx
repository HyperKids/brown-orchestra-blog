# Support the Brown University Orchestra!

The Brown University Orchestra is widely recognized as one of the finest university orchestras in the United States. Founded in 1918, the Brown Orchestra has toured China and Ireland, performed in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall, and won seven ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music. The Brown University Orchestra is dedicated to matching Brown's financial aid standards. When special tours and events require additional funds from each orchestra member, costs are reduced for any student on financial aid. In some cases, a student with significant need may have an entire trip across the globe paid in full so that they can perform with the orchestra. The orchestra is more than just an organization of musicians. It is a family.

Please consider supporting the Brown University Orchestra Gift Fund and helping us achieve our musical dreams! At the moment, we are working hard to raise funds for an international tour for the upcoming 2020-2021 season, and any support is greatly appreciated!
