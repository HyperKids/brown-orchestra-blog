# Introduction

With roots dating back to 1858, the Brown University Orchestra (BUO) is one of the oldest
organizations on campus. Consisting of approximately 100 musicians from Brown and RISD,
the BUO has given concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, toured China and Ireland, and
hosted renowned artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Mstislav Rostropovich, Isaac Stern, Eugenia
Zukerman, Dave Brubeck, and Joan Tower. In March 2016, the orchestra’s album Manhattan
Intermezzo topped the classical charts as the #1 best-selling Naxos recording worldwide.
Recent programming has featured classics like Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 and Igor
Stravinsky’s Petrushka, residencies with composer John Harbison and Silkroad Ensemble
composer/clarinetist Kinan Azmeh, and Vijay Iyer’s violin concerto Trouble with the Brown Arts
Initiative Fitt artist-in-residence Jennifer Koh.

In addition to presenting inspiring programming of the highest caliber, the BUO provides an
ideal environment for musicians to put their liberal arts education into action. Nearly every
academic concentration is represented in the orchestra’s membership and, in the spirit of the
Open Curriculum, students have the opportunity to connect their experience in BUO to other
facets of their Brown education. While large gatherings are on pause during the COVID-19
pandemic, this interdisciplinary learning is moving into the foreground. For the fall 2020
semester, BUO is transitioning into an academic course about how musical ensembles can
engage in activism and advocate for social causes. Many students participate in BUO
throughout their four years at Brown, and it is a cornerstone of their curricular and community
experience.

The construction of Brown’s Performing Arts Center creates exciting new opportunities for the
BUO. The venue, which has been designed with the orchestra’s needs in mind, will expand the
ensemble’s reach by doubling current audience capacity and facilitate the development of
innovative new work. The flexibility of the space will enable the BUO to collaborate with a wide
range of multidisciplinary partners in drama, dance, visual art, and multimedia in ways that have
not been possible at Brown before.

# The Opportunity

In order to build on the orchestra’s tradition of excellence and launch a new and exciting chapter
during this unprecedented time, we need to provide more focused funding for both
facilities/equipment and programming. Thank you for your consideration of supporting the
following fund.

## Orchestra Director’s Innovation Fund

Your support will provide critical funds for the Orchestra Director and leadership as they
enhance Brown’s musical curriculum, elevating the profile and capabilities of the University
under the umbrella of the Brown Arts Initiative. These flexible resources will allow for the
development and commission of original and collaborative programming, both domestic and
international travel, and instrument maintenance, among a myriad of other needs.

Your gift will allow the Orchestra Director to fund activities such as:

### Orchestra Music and Instrument Resources

Your support provides resources for material needs such as instrument maintenance
and acquisition, sheet music purchases and rentals, and commissioning fees for new
work. The orchestra’s instrument collection, including percussion, auxiliary woodwinds, a
harp, and orchestral strings, is an essential resource for students who would not
otherwise have access to these instruments.

### Visiting Artists/Fellows

Your support enables the University to invite leading music professionals to share their
talents and expertise with the campus community via short-term and ongoing
residencies.

### Travel Funds - International & Domestic

Your support provides the critical funds needed to support the Orchestra’s travel both
domestically and abroad. As the Brown University Orchestra’s prominence continues to
rise, it is our goal to fund one domestic trip per year and one international trip every other
year.

### Music Lessons

Your support fosters more equitable access to Brown’s Applied Music Program, which
provides individual private lessons for academic credit. Some students face a financial
barrier that excludes them from this curricular resource, affecting their opportunities for
musical education, course credit, and participation in musical performance activities.
Supporting this opportunity would allow students of all economic backgrounds to grow as
musicians.

# Conclusion

This is a transformative period for the arts, and specifically music, at Brown. Building on
Distinction, the strategic plan championed by President Paxson, is focused on amplifying the
best characteristics of the University, and the arts at Brown are among its greatest strengths.
Our faculty, staff, and students are committed to driving enhancements that will elevate Brown’s
capacity to graduate talented, socially engaged individuals. As the University moves forward
with the BrownTogether campaign, we appreciate your willingness to consider a gift that will
have an immediate and long-lasting impact on the University’s Orchestra.
